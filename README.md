# Introduction
Welcome to my GutHub page. A work-in-progress no doubt. Here we'll be exploring all my public repos.

## About Me

Born and raised in the city of Los Angeles, California. After highschool I left Los Angeles and moved to Boston, MA where I completed
my B.S. Computer Engineering. 


## More To Come
I'll be sharing more projects on GitHub soon enough. Thanks, and drop by soon!
